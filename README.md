# 🔐 Azure SIEM Project – Security Information and Event Management

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the deployment and configuration of a **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** solution using **Microsoft Azure Sentinel**. It focuses on centralized log management, threat detection, and real-time monitoring of infrastructure and services in a cloud-based environment.

The goal is to showcase how defensive security practices and Azure-native tools can be integrated to monitor, detect, and respond to cyber threats effectively.
